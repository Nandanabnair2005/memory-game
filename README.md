# memory-game
### Q1:What did you learn while making this app?
Sure! Here's a short version:

> Making a Simon game helps me to learn how to store and compare sequences, handle user input, use timers, and control game flow, while practicing basic programming concepts like variables, loops, and conditionals.


### Q2:What feature did you enjoy building the most?

Tthe feature I'd enjoy most is the increasing sequence challenge where each round adds a new color to remember. It creates tension and excitement, pushing your memory and focus further each time. From a coding perspective, it's also fun to implement because it combines logic and timing, 


### Q3:What would you add next if you had more time?

If I had more time, I would add a scoreboard and difficulty levels to make the game more engaging. The scoreboard would track high scores, and difficulty levels could control the speed of the sequence or add distractions like flashing lights and extra sounds.
